The error you encountered indicates a conflict between the package you're trying to install (`nodejs`) and an existing package (`libnode-dev`) that has a conflicting file (`/usr/include/node/common.gypi`).

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Remove the conflicting package:
   ```shell
   sudo apt remove libnode-dev
   ```

2. Clean the package cache:
   ```shell
   sudo apt clean
   ```

3. Retry the installation of Node.js:
   ```shell
   sudo apt install nodejs
   ```

If the above steps don't work, you can try the following alternative approach:

1. Force the installation of `nodejs` while overwriting the conflicting file:
   ```shell
   sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/nodejs_16.20.0-deb-1nodesource1_amd64.deb
   ```

2. Fix any broken dependencies:
   ```shell
   sudo apt --fix-broken install
   ```

This command will attempt to fix any broken dependencies and complete the installation.

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, it may be helpful to search for specific solutions related to the Ubuntu version and Node.js version you're using. Additionally, checking the official NodeSource documentation or seeking support from the NodeSource community forums may provide further insights.
